## Screenshots - Out of date already!

**Does anyone know a quick way to generate this type of demo image?**

See [this page](static/screenshots/screenshots.md) for example screenshots.

## Installation - Native Python

*These steps describe how I set it up. I use a linux terminal so under Windows there may be minor step inaccuracies.*

1.  Clone repo to a local directory.
    eg: `git clone https://github.com/danricho/where_the.git where_the`

1.  Create a Python Virtual Environment (venv).
    eg: `python3 -m venv venv`

1.  Install dependencies via pip into your venv.
    eg: `venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt` or activate venv then `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

1.  Create `config.yml` and update according it to your setup - see the [Configuration section](#configuration-configyml).

1.  Run `main.py` in your venv.
    eg: `venv/bin/python main.py` or activate venv then `python main.py` 

## Installation - Docker Compose

*Running in Docker is a quick way to get this to run as a service (launches on boot etc).*

1. Clone repo to a local directory.
   eg: `git clone https://github.com/danricho/where_the.git where_the`

1. Create `config.yml` and update according to the [Configuration section](#configuration-configyml). This file is mounted within the docker image but saved here outside it (to keep data between docker sessions)

1. Create `data.json` and set the content to `{}`. This file is mounted within the docker image but saved here outside it (to keep data between docker sessions)

1. Run the docker container using the command `docker-compose up -d`. 

1. To troubleshoot the container it may help to see it's logs: `docker logs where_the`

## Updating to the latest GitHub version

To update, all that shoule be needed is to run the command `git pull` in your Where The ?!? directory.

If you get a message about local file changes which would be overwritten by merge, this means you have modified one of the tracked files. The config and data files (as made during installation) are not the files git is talking about. 

The command `git diff` will tell you what is different about the files. Running `git reset --hard HEAD` will reset the uncommited file changes, but **NOTE THAT** you may lose work if you do this. Only do this if you understand what you are doing. And once your Repo is clean, the `git pull` whould work.

There are many resources available online to learn more about Git operations.

## Configuration (config.yml)

```yaml
# DO NOT ADD COMMENTS YOU WANT KEPT TO THIS YML AS IT IS REWRITTEN BY THE APP AND COMMENTS ARE LOST.

SITE: 
  BASE_URL: http://localhost # THIS IS YOUR DOMAIN OR START OF YOUR URL - USED IN QR CODE
  PATH_PREFIX: / # THIS IS USEFUL IF YOU WANT A PREFIX ON THE URL PATH - USED IN QR CODE AND FLASK

# THE MAIN COLOR. 
# THE DEFAULT #C0A890 IS BASED ON A CARBOARD BOX COLOR :)
# CAN BE ANY VALID CSS COLOR STRING - EG: rgb(128,128,128)
PRIMARY-COLOR: '#C0A890'

# AUTHELIA IS AN AUTHENTICATION MIDDLEWARE USEFUL WHEN USING TRAEFIK FOR ROUTING
# 'WHERE THE ?!?' READS THE AUTHENTICATION HEADERS AUTHELIA PROVIDES ONCE LOGGED

# ACCESSING 'WHERE THE ?!?' WHEN USING AUTHELIA.

## What's Next / Future Improvements

I plan to start using it more to identify the holes I haven't found yet!  
I do have a few ideas that I'd like to add while maintaining the current simplicity as much as possible.  

Please propose and discuss ideas [here](https://github.com/danricho/where_the/discussions)!

My ideas so far (most would be choosen via a `config.yml` option):â€‹
- Add `Dark Mode` to Chota CSS, which is very easy (as per the Chota webpage) and a toggle for it in the fixed header
- Add additional storage options other than raw JSON file  - [discussion](https://github.com/danricho/where_the/discussions/3)
- UI improvements - [discussion](https://github.com/danricho/where_the/discussions/9)
- Code improvements - [discussion](https://github.com/danricho/where_the/discussions/7)

I welcome contributions to these with Pull requests!
